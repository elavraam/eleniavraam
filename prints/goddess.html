          <p class="bodytext"> <br> Goddess is a collection of 7 images that were created while I thought I was working on a book of photographs taken in Berlin two years ago combining erotica, architecture, religion, and death, to be exhibited with a live performance of its homonymous track <i><b>Just Call Me Angel</b></i> featuring me singing over hypnotic cathedral bells.</br>

<br>Intense colour saturation, repetition and reflections kept returning in joyous mindless hours and Goddess was slowly but boldly revealed as an erotic collection of surreal, psychedelic and lurid visions of the Feminine Divine. These will be released as individual prints once a month beginning 20 March 2020 in celebration of the Spring Equinox through to my birthday 18 September 2020.</br>

<br><b>Limited editions of 49 C-Type Metallic </b>prints (c. 210 x 140 mm), hand numbered & signed. Each of these  will come lovingly packaged in beautiful poetry-chapbook-meets-rave-flyer hardback covers and accompanied by inserts of a text I love and a soundtrack playlist. So, you know, they’ll be special…</br>

<br>There will also be the opportunity to buy larger size prints of these, limited to 7 copies at c. 420 x 280 mm and 1 copy at c. 841 x 561 mm.</br>

<br>A special thank you to Lilly Markaki for photographing me in Berlin that strange and fateful night two years and holding up the mirror to me for these visions to come through, and for her Love, always.</br>

<br>Details & pre-orders for Pt. I coming soon…</br>
